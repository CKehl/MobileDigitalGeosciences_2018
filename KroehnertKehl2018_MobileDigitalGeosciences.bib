  Abstract                 = {Abstract Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Structure from Motion (SfM) provide large amounts of digital data from which virtual outcrops can be created. The accuracy of these surface reconstructions is critical for quantitative structural analysis. Assessment of LiDAR and SfM methodologies suggest that SfM results are comparable to high data-density LiDAR on individual surfaces. The effect of chosen acquisition technique on the full outcrop and the efficacy on its virtual form for quantitative structural analysis and prediction beyond single bedding surfaces, however, is less certain. Here, we compare the accuracy of digital virtual outcrop analysis with traditional field data, for structural measurements and along-strike prediction of fold geometry from Stackpole syncline. In this case, the SfM virtual outcrop, derived from \{UAV\} imagery, yields better along-strike predictions and a more reliable geological model, in spite of lower accuracy surface reconstructions than LiDAR. This outcome is attributed to greater coverage by \{UAV\} and reliable reconstruction of a greater number of bedding planes than terrestrial LiDAR, which suffers from the effects of occlusion. Irrespective of the chosen acquisition technique, we find that workflows must incorporate careful survey planning, data processing and quality checking of derived data if virtual outcrops are to be used for robust structural analysis and along-strike prediction. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The use of lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) systems for modelling petroleum reservoir analogues has become increasingly popular over the past few years, and there has been a proliferation of articles on the subject both on techniques and applications. A review of the literature of recent years has been conducted focussing on the use of lidar data not only in petroleum geology related projects, but also looking to the wider field of lidar usage to examine what other approaches may be of use to the petroleum geologist. Benefits of digital data acquisition are considered, as well as a basic overview of data collection approaches. Use of a variety of attributes (intensity, colour, dip, azimuth, co-linearity, co-planarity among others) is discussed as an aid to both manual and automated interpretation approaches. Integration of lidar data with other data types from traditional field data (sedimentary logs for example) and other digital data types such as multispectral and hyperspectral imagery, and ground penetrating radar are discussed as a way of increasing the amount of information in the digital dataset. The application of artificial intelligence approaches such as Smart Swarms and Neural Networks are considered, as well as current developments in both hardware and software. A variety of examples are given where lidar has been used in an innovative or interesting way, showing the strength of this data acquisition approach when combined with appropriate interpretation and modelling techniques. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Although paper and pencil approaches to geological mapping continue, digital mapping tools are being increasing implemented in field geology. Of particular note is the use of an electronic compass/inclinometer built into tablets and smartphones for obtaining orientation data where an important question is the reliability of these digital devices relative to conventional, analogue compass/inclinometers. This paper deals with this question through detailed tests of two android devices: an Honor 3C smartphone and a Lenovo B8080-F tablet. In order to evaluate potential electronic noise effects the devices were tested in two modes, standard and airplane. Over 14,000 readings from the sensors were collected to evaluate the stability of the sensor's readings and showed that the magnetic sensor in the tablet was unacceptably unstable. Seven geological compass applications were installed on the Honor 3C smartphone and tested against the analogue Freiberg geological compass in a field experiment. During the experiment 25 fractures varying in azimuth and dip were measured using both devices. A high level of disagreement was observed with discrepancies as high as 80 degree with azimuthal errors dominant. Analysis of the time series in the data suggest the source of the problem was instability in the magnetic sensor for the smartphone, despite the fact the device passed the initial stability test. Although only two devices were studied these data indicate care must be taken to evaluate compass accuracy on these devices.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Limited bandwidth is a strong constraint when efficient transmission of 3D data to Web clients and mobile applications is needed. In this paper we present a novel multi-resolution WebGL based rendering algorithm which combines progressive loading, view-dependent resolution and mesh compression, providing high frame rates and a decoding speed of million of triangles per second in JavaScript. The method is parallelizable and scalable to very large models. The algorithm is based on the local multi-resolution approaches provided by the community, but ad-hoc solutions had to be studied and implemented to provide adequate performances. In particular, a compression mechanism that reached very high compression rate without impact on rendering performance was implemented. Moreover, the data partition strategy was modified in order to be able to load different types of data (i.e. point clouds) and better adapt to the potentials and limitations of web-based rendering. },

  Abstract                 = {We propose a novel formulation for determining the absolute pose of a single or multi-camera system given a known vertical direction. The vertical direction may be easily obtained by detecting the vertical vanishing points with computer vision techniques, or with the aid of IMU sensor measurements from a smartphone. Our solver is general and able to compute absolute camera pose from two 2D-3D correspondences for single or multi-camera systems. We run several synthetic experiments that demonstrate our algorithm's improved robustness to image and IMU noise compared to the current state of the art. Additionally, we run an image localization experiment that demonstrates the accuracy of our algorithm in real-world scenarios. Finally, we show that our algorithm provides increased performance for real-time model-based tracking compared to solvers that do not utilize the vertical direction and show our algorithm in use with an augmented reality application running on a Google Tango tablet.},

  Abstract                 = {Laser scanning is a very efficient way to generate realistic, high-resolution digital models of 3-D geological outcrops. This paper discusses the methodologies involved in the creation and analysis of virtual outcrops, based on laser scanner data. The visualisation of the laser scanner data as a photorealistic 3-D object is described. Geological features picked out on the virtual outcrop (e.g. fractures, faults or bedding planes) can be extrapolated outward, into space, and inward, into the subsurface, using tension surfaces.},
