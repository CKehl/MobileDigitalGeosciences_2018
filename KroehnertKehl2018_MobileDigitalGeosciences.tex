\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item computing equipment continuously elevates the analytical capabilities for solving geoscientific problems
\item large drawback on computing equipment: the more powerful it is, the more stationary it is
\item geoscience disciplines such as hydrology, geology or glaciology are driven by outdoor experiments that prohibit bulky equipment
\item the advent of mobile computing equipment, such as smartphones and tablets, provides a possible solution to the equipment problem
\item form factor of mobile devices is small enough to allow every field-related geoscientist to carry one in the field
\item as seen is popular articles, the range of available devices increases, which allows to find a devices fit-for-purpose to each situation
\item range of devices also comes with a range of capabilities that influence their usability for specific field tasks
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item availability of small form factor devices is only on part contribution to making digital geosciences more ''mobile``
\item availability and easy access to geoscience data (e.g. domain-specific maps, \glspl{DEM}, surface models in 3D) is equally important to perform combined digital- and field analysis
\item while basemap access on mobile devices is trivial, surface-scanned data in form of point clouds and (textured) triangulated meshes is becoming increasingly available with novice-operable \gls{SfM} software and drones
\item crowdsourced data and \gls{VGI} provides numerous data for domain-specific analysis, which is facilitated by easier data capture from amateur scientists using mobile devices
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item In order to connect data and devices in the field, domain-specific mobile software is required
\item the difficulties in mobile software development stem from the specific demands and challenges for mobile software, such as energy efficiency, multi-manufacturer support, smart sensor utilisation [add and expand]
\item with the emergence of new application cases, which are demonstrated and discussed in this article, and an increasing interest from geoscience- and computer technology industry, a significant rise in the mobile software availability for geoscience problem solving is expected for the near-term future
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Challenges

\section{Applications and Requirements}
\label{sec:applications}
Due to the increasing usability of mobile devices for in the field annotations, several use cases concerning geosciences has become apparent. In the following, two essential 

\subsection{Derivation of hydrological parameters: Water level gauging}
\label{sec:water_level_gauging_intro}
The last decade is characterized by a continued increase of globally devastating flash floods after heavy rainfalls. Even smallest creeks turned into hazardous streams causing flooding and landslides. Conventional gauging stations provide precise information about water levels measured over a short time period. For official gauges in Germany, standard derivation of one centimetre is required \cite{Siedschlag2015} [need more references]. But they are rather cost expensive in purchase and maintenance and thus just sparsely installed. Exemplary, the overall distribution of gauging stations in Saxony, Germany amounts to 154 compared to 259 creeks and rivers with small, medium and large catchments \citep{Saxon2018}. Thus, around a third can not be monitored neither during flood events when the most protection is required. Recently, commercial smartphone applications arose to enable crowd-sourcing based water level data acquisition \cite{CrowdWaterApp2017a, Kisters2014}. But all of them have one thing in common: the water level is entered manually by engaged citizen scientists finding and photographing tide gauges close to rivers which makes them not only a potential danger to themselves (f.e. by sudden landslides) but also it is still limited to open and visible gauges.

Improvements in this sense can be achieved through image-2-geometry intersection and 3D annotation for automatic water level determination without reference gauges for almost every situation regarding running waters. 
for this, the smartphone application \textit{Open Water Level} that bases on the freely available open source camera framework \textit{Open Camera} \cite{Harman2017}. Open Water Level allows for free stationing water line detection using short hand held time-lapse image sequences (for details please refer to \cite{Kroehnert2017}). To interpret these, image measurements must be transformed into object space. Thus, exterior information needs to be provided by smartphone sensors for orientation and positioning.

\subsubsection{Requirements applying to the sensors}
\label{sec:water_level_gauging_requirements}
To solve the task of autonomous water level determination on running rivers f.e. emergency cases using image-2-geometry intersection, citizen scientists position and orientation must be know. As figured out in \ref{sec:technology}, smartphone sensors accuracies for orientation and location are highly dependent on user's environment. Especially the strong correlation of heading and disturbing magnetic sources may be a issue must be solved specifically related to running rivers where metal railings usually exists. Similar effects can also be noted using high-end IMU systems for instance autonomous car navigation. But the magnetic influences inside cars are almost stable and can be calibrated during the drive (advanced navigation manual). For smartphone orientation, the magnetic strengths attaching the phone may change substantially in short time. A typical scenario would be: a citizen scientist walks along street, taking his phone inside the baggage close to metallic keys. While walking he passes several street lamps, signs, etc. Finally, he arrives at a bridge over a urban river, takes out the phone, looks down to the river and records the time lapse image sequence a few centimetres above a metallic railing. Meanwhile, several cars passing the same bridge. In this simple use case, the magnetic field around the smartphone changes countless times due to several unpredictable disturbances.

\item (FIGURE WITH HEADING TEST  $\rightarrow$ CHANGED HEADING WHAT DOES IT MAKE FOR)
