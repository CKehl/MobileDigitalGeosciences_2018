\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item computing equipment continuously elevates the analytical capabilities for solving geoscientific problems
\item large drawback on computing equipment: the more powerful it is, the more stationary it is
\item geoscience disciplines such as hydrology, geology or glaciology are driven by outdoor experiments that prohibit bulky equipment
\item the advent of mobile computing equipment, such as smartphones and tablets, provides a possible solution to the equipment problem
\item form factor of mobile devices is small enough to allow every field-related geoscientist to carry one in the field
\item as seen is popular articles, the range of available devices increases, which allows to find a devices fit-for-purpose to each situation
\item range of devices also comes with a range of capabilities that influence their usability for specific field tasks
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item availability of small form factor devices is only on part contribution to making digital geosciences more ''mobile``
\item availability and easy access to geoscience data (e.g. domain-specific maps, \glspl{DEM}, surface models in 3D) is equally important to perform combined digital- and field analysis
\item while basemap access on mobile devices is trivial, surface-scanned data in form of point clouds and (textured) triangulated meshes is becoming increasingly available with novice-operable \gls{SfM} software and drones
\item crowdsourced data and \gls{VGI} provides numerous data for domain-specific analysis, which is facilitated by easier data capture from amateur scientists using mobile devices
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item In order to connect data and devices in the field, domain-specific mobile software is required
\item the difficulties in mobile software development stem from the specific demands and challenges for mobile software, such as energy efficiency, multi-manufacturer support, smart sensor utilisation [add and expand]
\item with the emergence of new application cases, which are demonstrated and discussed in this article, and an increasing interest from geoscience- and computer technology industry, a significant rise in the mobile software availability for geoscience problem solving is expected for the near-term future
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Even considering the fast technological development, some challenges around mobile device development exists that are rooted in the technology itself
\item several techniques and methods - such as \gls{SfM}, \gls{VR} or \gls{AR} - have been demonstrated to work on small-scale lab studies in computer science itself
\item translation and adaptation of these techniques to specific geoscience case studies and domain-specific issues is prohibited by scale and reliability
\item Other challenges influencing mobile digital geosciences are short-comings in geo-localization accuracy, object matching- and registration accuracy, geometric- and photometric data processing, data volumes and the availability of off-the-shelf program codes to common problems in computing
\item these problems are already familiar to disciplines such as software engineering, photogrammetry and data science for established computing platforms (e.g. PCs, workstations, laptops)
\item there are also problems specific or exclusive to mobile device processes, which are discussed in detail in this article
\item they contain issues such as device variability, power consumption and computing efficiency (i.e. fast calculations with drastically limited computing capabilities)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item For the next sections, the article adheres to following structure:
\item First, use cases are presented as opening statements to introduce task that are exclusively addressed by mobile devices in the digital geosciences
\item Secondly, the basics for 3D digital processing for our cases are presented. The overview is limited to the applied concepts to mobile devices and the extensions necessary to make the mapping to such devices.
\item Then, algorithms that are key to the digital geosciences outdoors are presented. The overview is also meant to highlight that alternative methods are available to achieve the target tasks
\item Fourth, the algorithms are mapped to the specific mobile technologies and components. The technologies and major parameters that impact geoscience problem applicability are highlighted.
\item Finally, we showcase and discuss how available mobile systems are used in application scenarios from hydrology and petroleum geology to improve analysis processes, help disseminating acquired knowledge and integrate outdoor measurements in digital workflows
\item Then, the article is finalized with some concluding remarks and a discussion for future developments in this research trajectory
\end{itemize}
